# Instagram Clone App

It is a very simple instagram clone app, uses following technologies:

- react native
- redux
- redux-thunk
- react-navigation v5
- axios
- eslint & prettier
- react-native-fast-image
- react-native-video

The app design is not ideal, however the architecture is well-established and performance optimisations are done.
